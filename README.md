## How to get started with the challenges

Make sure you have a working development environment: an IDE, Node.JS 8.

- Fork and clone the repository.
- Install the dependencies: `npm i`
- Run the (failing) tests for the challenge.
- Implement the solution, until the tests pass.
- Feel free to add your own tests
- Commit the solution to your fork.

### Challenge 01: Pattern Converter

Running tests: `npx jest -w __test__/01`

Implement the solution in: `src/01/pattern-converter.js`

## About this project

This project contains JavaScript challenges which aim to introduce software craft concepts like [S.O.L.I.D. architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_-\(object-oriented_design\)) and [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development).

I also show some common project defaults when writing JavaScript code (like linting).

 - [standard](https://www.npmjs.com/package/standard) defines how the source code should be formatted. Use `npm run lint -- --fix` to automatically fix your source code formatting.
 - [commitlint](http://marionebl.github.io/commitlint/) enforces a certain (parseable) format of commit messages.
